Started the backtesting project in java, (being having rich java experience), to be of very small need, initially created classes per strategy, 
but started converging classes to single class to gain a little productivity.
As my program was growing with many strategies, adding new strategy in the same becoming challenging.
Asking chatgpt/gemini/copilot etc and exploring new strategies & then generate program from same.
You have some idea, but first for given idea, either write code on your own or ask one from llm is one thing.
Fitting that to the system becomes a little challenge. As at times generated code is expecting something else.
You spend more time in building the logic than verification.
Files getting too big to handle.



So, I decided to let me focus on Ideation part.
Idea was to start with whatever have to act as tools, which will generate output in files/db.
New tools should be generated and added later.
